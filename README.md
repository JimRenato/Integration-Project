Yeti Strikes Back
=============

*This game was created to study and practice the use of predator-prey artificial intelligence.*

**Predator-Prey:** The predator goal is to capture the prey, whereas the prey goal is escape the predator.

**Objective:** In Yeti Strikes Back we have two characters, the Human who is camping in a forest and the Yeti who is hungry and is behind the Human for dinner. Win who reach the goal first.

**How it works:** The game draws a starting position for the Human, the Yeti and the Human's cabin.
The Human and the Yeti are controlled by the AI that will direct the Human to the cabin and the Yeti that goes towards the Human. Remembering that if the Human realizes that he will not have a chance, he starts running from the Yeti.
